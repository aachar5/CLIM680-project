# ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSION MAPPING OVER THE CONUS FOR MULTISPECIES OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS

### Aasma Acharya
### CLIM 680

## INTRODUCTION
##### My CLIM680 project will explore the emission pattern for different species of atmospheric pollutants basically to see how the emission varies spatially within the CONUS. This project will analyze annual total emissions for VOCs, NOx, PM2.5, SO2, CO, and NH3 measured in terms of ton/km2/yr.
