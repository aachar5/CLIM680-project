<h1> EMISSION MAPPING FOR MULTISPECIES OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS OVER THE CONUS </h1>
<h3> Introduction <h3>
<font size="-1"> It is important to track emission of harmful gaseous and particulate matter such as NOX, SO2, CO, NH3 and PM2.5 as these pollutants, including greenhouse gasses, are significant climate forcers. The data I am using for my research represents the point source emissions collected from different inventories over the CONUS and aggregated to extract the final annually averaged emission for the entire CONUS.My CLIM680 project will explore the emission pattern for different species of atmospheric pollutants basically to see how the emission varies spatially within the CONUS. This project will analyze annual total emissions for VOCs, NOx, PM2.5, SO2, CO, and NH3 measured in terms of ton/km2/yr.
