<h1> EMISSION MAPPING FOR MULTISPECIES OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS OVER THE CONUS </h1>

<h3> Introduction <h3>
<h3> </Body> <font size="+1"> It is important to track emission of harmful gaseous and particulate matter such as NOX, SO2, CO, NH3 and PM2.5 as these pollutants, including greenhouse gasses, are significant climate forcers. The data I am using for my research represents the point source emissions collected from different inventories over the CONUS and aggregated to extract the final annually averaged emission for the entire CONUS.My CLIM680 project will explore the emission pattern for different species of atmospheric pollutants basically to see how the emission varies spatially within the CONUS. This project will analyze annual total emissions for VOCs, NOx, PM2.5, SO2, CO, and NH3 measured in terms of ton/km2/yr.

<h3> Dataset Description <h3>
 <h3> </Body> <font size = "+1"> The name of the dataset I am using is Neighborhood Emission Mapping Operation (NEMO). This data contains annual total emission of VOCs, NOx, PM2.5, SO2, CO, and NH3 by sector in NetCDF format. These are the anthropogenic emissions from the National Emissions Inventory. The unit is ton/km2/yr. The base year I have used in this analysis is 2017. It is collected in 1 km resolution grid and the temporal resolution I am using here is monthly i.e every month has one averaged vaue of emission.The source sector of these emissions are anthropogenic fugitive dust (afdust), agriculture (ag),non-point (nonpt), oil and gas operations (np_oilgas), onroad, nonroad, rail, residential wood combustion (rwc), and airports.
